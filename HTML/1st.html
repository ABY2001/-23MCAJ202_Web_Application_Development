    <h2>VIRAT KOHLI</h2>

        India has given to the world many a great cricketer but perhaps none as ambitious as Virat Kohli. 
        To meet his ambition, Kohli employed the technical assiduousness of Sachin Tendulkar and fitness 
        that was in the league of top athletes in the world, not just cricketers. As a result, Kohli became 
        the most consistent all-format accumulator of his time, making jaw-dropping chases look easy, and 
        finding, in his own words, the safest possible way to score runsâ€”plenty of them.
        <br><br>
        This ambition transferred seamlessly to his captaincy: he demanded more than ever of his bowlers, 
        especially the quick ones, often sacrificed a batsman for bowling depth, and led India to a long 
        stay at No. 1 in Test rankings and a first-ever series win in Australia. He is well on his way 
        to ending up as India's most successful Test captain.<a href="https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/virat-kohli-253802">Click to read more</a>
